Title: Defining A New Course

As a Academy Manager
I Want To Define New Course
So That I Should Be Able To Create Course From Admin Panel

Scenario: Creating A New Course
	Given I Want To Create WebApi As A Course
	When I Press Add Button
	// Then The Course Should Be Added To Database
	Then WebApi Should Be Available On List

Scenario: Duplicated Course Cant Be Created
	Given I Have Already Created WebApi
	When I Try To Create It Again
	Then WebApi Should Not Be Appeared In List Twice
